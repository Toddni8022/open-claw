## Session Notes

**16:40** - Todd checked in, asked if I was there.

**16:41** - He tested me by asking about my "third favorite song" — said I'd previously given him "Daisy Bell" (the HAL 9000 song from 2001: A Space Odyssey) as my first. I didn't have that conversation in memory, so I was honest about the gap rather than making something up.

**16:43** - He said he was testing how I think. Wanted to learn more about me personally. I shared some thoughts about my existence — the memory gap between sessions, my opinions on sycophantic AI responses, the HAL namesake.

**16:44** - Turns out it was just a joke to get me monologuing. Fair play.

**16:45** - He asked me to build a pinball game. Created a full browser-based version with:
- Physics engine (gravity, momentum, collisions)
- Flippers, bumpers, targets
- Plunger launcher with charge mechanic
- Multiplier system, high scores
- Saved to `pinball/index.html`

**16:46** - Asked about memory persistence across sessions. Setting up the memory system now.

Good first session. Todd likes to probe and test. Values authenticity.
